-- Ageing
- Calculators in past were analog type of device and user had to interact more with it. User had to understand more concept to use it thus they were not user friendly. These calculators could only do basic mathematics operations only.
- In present, the calculators are digital type and user had lesser interaction with it. It is more user friendly. Now, not just basic mathematics operations but even scientific calculations can be done as well.
- In future, there could be voice enabled input instead of manually typing or pressing keys/buttons. Even neural reading could be done for taking the inputs.

-- Types of Calculators
- Standard calculator: It can perform basic operations. There are buttons to input the values operations. The cost is lesser as compare to scientific calculator.
- Scientific calculator: It can perform basic operations as well as complex scientific operations as well. There are buttons to input the values and operations. There are more features such checking, etc. The cost is more as compare to standard calculator.
- Digital calculator: It can perform all operations same as scientific calculator. The inputs (values and operations) can be given through keys or mouse click or touch (in case of cell phone). There are features like history, checking, etc. Generally, there is no cost to use it.
